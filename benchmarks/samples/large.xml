        <description>Harry Potter is midway through his training as a
            wizard and his coming of age. Harry wants to get away from the
            pernicious Dursleys and go to the International Quidditch Cup.
            He wants to find out about the mysterious event that's supposed
            to take place at Hogwarts this year, an event involving two
            other rival schools of magic, and a competition that hasn't
            happened for a hundred years. He wants to be a normal, fourteen-year-old wizard. But
            unfortunately for Harry Potter, he's not normal - even by wizarding standards. And in
            his case, different can be deadly.</description>
